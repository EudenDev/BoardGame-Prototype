These are guidelines not rules

:: CHARACTERS

- Prefabs for each actor/character should go inside: 
Characters/CharacterName/ActorName.prefab
- Enemy troops prefabs should go on this level.
- Enemies are also chracters.
- Voices for each character should go inside Characters/ActorName/Sounds/

The reason Player folder begins with an underscore "_" it's so it'll
appear as the first folder.

:: MODELS & ANIMATIONS

- MODEL FILE NAMING:
model_name.fbx

- ANIMATED MODEL NAME:
model_name@Idle.fbx

- ANIMATION CLIP NAME:
model_name_Walk.anim

ONLY VOICES should be inside it's character, sounds like stepping, kicks,
attacks and so on, go in Sounds/SE
If a sound is really exclusive to that character, it IS a voice.

These are guidelines not rules.


:: VFX
Any Visual Effect.

- Sounds go should go in Sounds/SE/YourEffect.wav

- Any code that is used to trigger the effect should be here
*unless* the purpose of the script is more than show the effect.
E.g. It also deals damage, or controls another script inside Code/


:: TEXTURES FOLDER
If you think that your texture could be reused for other effects, or is a
generic texture (like noises), put it in this folder:

VFX/_Textures/YourNoiseTexture.png


:: FOLDER STRUCTURE

This varies a lot from effect to another just try to keep a good structure :/

-  Custom Post Process
VFX/
    ../PostProcess/
        ColorShift.shader
        ColorShift.mat
        ...
        
        
- Amplify Functions
VFX/
    ../AmpFunctions/
        YourFunction.asset
        

- Shader + Material + Prefab:
VFX/
    ../ShaderName/ (Use the name of the shader)
    
        RedExplosion.prefab
        
        AlphaCut.shader
        Explosion.mat
       
       
- NO shader; particles prefab + material + mesh
VFX/
    ../PrefabName/
        CollectBonusFX.prefab
        
        CollectParticles.mat
        Collect_Trails.fbx

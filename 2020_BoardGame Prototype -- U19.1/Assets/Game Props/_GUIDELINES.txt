These are guidelines not rules.

:: PROPS
Only interactive props should be here.

Any prop that is static, or has no complex interaction is
a decoration, and they should go in Enviroment/


:: FOLDER STRUCTURE
May change with project complexity

- For a simple project:

Props/
    
    HealthBonus.prefab  (So it's easy to drag and drop to the scene)
    
    ../HealthBonus/    (Other names: Source/Editables/Supplies)
        Bonus.fbx
        HealthBonus.mat
        BonusTexture.png
            
            
- For a complex project:

Props/
    ../BreakebleBox/    (Name of your prop)
    
        Box.prefab
        BoxBroken.prefab
        ...
        ../Meshes/
            Box.fbx
            Box@broken.fbx
            ...
        ../Materials/
            NormalBox.mat
            BrokenBox.mat
            ...
        ../Textures/
            Box_color.png
            Box_normal.png
            ...
        ../Animation/
            BoxAnimation.controller
            Box_Broken.anim
            ...

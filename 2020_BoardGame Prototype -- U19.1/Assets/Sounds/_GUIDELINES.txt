These are guidelines not rules

Files must end with the type of sound clip they represent:
Examples:
clip_name_BGM.ogg
ClipName_BGS.mp3
Clip name SE.wav

Case combination and format are irrelevant for now.

:: AUDIO MIXER
The audio mixer already contains groups for the following sound types:
BGM - BGS - SE - VOICES


:: SE - Sound Effects
SE : Sound Effect, short sounds for interfaces and visual effects
Try to describe the sound on the naming, also use folders for different
categories if needed.
SE/UI/Selection_Clic_SE.wav
SE/HealthUp_SE.mp3


:: BGM - BackGround Music
BGM : BackGroud Music, music to be used in game scenes
For example and overworld theme or the title screen music, by preference
loopable.


:: BGS - BackGround Sound
BGS : BackGround Sound, sound that can be looped to add ambiance, they are
subtle and can sometimes be looped.
for example: blowing wind, a riverside, birds in the forest. 


:: VOICES
Should be in Characters under its own character: Characters/ActorName/Sounds/
Grunts and voices comming from characters when getting hurt, jumping or 
falling. Enemies are also characters.

Naming examples:
ActorName_Jump1_VO.ogg
Moblin_Hurt2_VO.mp3

Other grunts that have no character representation are instead Sound Effects.
